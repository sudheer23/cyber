   \section{Introduction:} In recent years we are looking quiet disturbing fact innovation in attacking growing faster than defending. many miscellaneous attacks going on most popular websites. Guest Speaker Bob Stiso reveals interesting facts about how an attack is initiated and how it goes with in the system, consequences of the attack. He also mentioned how attackers are evolved to pass through any secure network. these attackers costs billions of dollars for organizations Ibm come up with solution to deal with it IBM i2 solutions next generation intelligence analysis\\
\section{theory:}
presentation explains how serious the situation is he explains with many examples of attacks
out of them i found sony attack interesting infact it open up mind consequences that may cause  you don't address the  problem in initial stage. in sony attack the hackers sit in the network for 8 months looking at the data and after knowing the flaws they started attacking The sony attack:  the attack on film studio sony picture entertainment is revealed the whole world importance of cyber analysis on november 24 2014 self proclaimed hacker group “guardians of peace” pulled sensitive data of employees executive salaries, copies of unreleased sony films  they done these attack to show world how powerful they are. this incident questioned entire security system \\
\section{consequences:}
IBM i2 solution is a helper for analysts to quickly connections and patterns, third party datasets and by monitoring that with artificial intelligence they will know the what type of attack that going to happen, thus we can develop a defending pattern to stop that attack  these is future we have to stop attackers at some point ibm i2 solutions opened door to stop these attacks we all have to be part of it and get rid of miscellaneous attacks anyway.\\


\section{Things learned} 

Importance and need of cyber intelligence in nowadays there are always some one who wants to look onto your personal data. we have to use artificial intelligence developed a secure network to free from attacks and always have to look what are the attacks going on your network and try to catch what they going to do and develop a defender at any cost consequences are high we can lose sensitive personal data\\
